SLURM scripts in this directory are NOT run on TACC (at the moment), these are just for keeping synced to remote.
- I house the scripts from a directory in $SCRATCH in /reproduce_socialjax/ in the TACC system.

For running on mac to test (without a script):
    1. Remember to "conda activate social-jax"
    2. Remember to " export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/socialjax:$PYTHONPATH" "
